# EigenModel

ML model generation based on data's eigen decomposition

Data considered here is breast cancer data available online. 

1. Check the eigendecomposition of data
2. Remove highly correlated variables
3. Check highest eigenvector variables and align data as per highest to lowest eigenvalues
4. Consider first few eigenvalues for further calculation of ML
5. Two models were tried and tested here
